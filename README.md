The OCaml pandoc library
========================

This library is meant to help creating filters for [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
which is tool to convert between textual formats, notably markdown and LaTeX. It
is vaguely inspired of the corresponding [Haskell
library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-types).
